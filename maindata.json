   "question": "What is farming and what are the different types of farming systems in India?",
   "answer": "The process of growing crops and rearing animals for food and raw materials like vegetables, fruits, milk, fibre, meat etc. is called farming. Under the broad spectrum of agriculture, farming is considered a small category which involves production of flowers, fruits, bio-fuels, drugs, fibres, nursery plants, manure and leather. Different types of farming systems practiced in India are:"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the importance of agriculture?",
   "answer": "Sometimes it is observed that agriculture is not just production of materials, but it also involves promotion, processing and distribution of produced materials. Agriculture is important because of the following reasons:\nSource of Livelihood\nContribution to National Income\nSupply of Food and Fodder\nVast Employment Opportunities\nOverall Economic Development\nSource of Government Income\n"
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the branches of agriculture?",
   "answer": "The different branches of agriculture are horticulture, aquaculture, dairy farming, organic farming, poultry, sericulture, vermiculture and market gardening. If the broad definition of agriculture is taken into consideration then it could also involve branches, like seed technology, Nematology, plant breeding and genetics, soil science, agronomy etc."
  },
  {
   "question": "How do farmers grow their crops?",
   "answer": "Farmers need to understand the local growing conditions, soil requirements, crop compatibility, etc. to have a successful farming business. The basic knowledge of cultivation along with the required resources helps farmers to grow their crops. The general requirements are soil/land, nutrients/fertilizers, air, water, sunlight and of course farm equipment. Apart from all these, farmers need investment (money) for getting seeds, manure, irrigation facilities, labour and other farm materials to begin with. Using all these resources at the right time for the right crop, farmers cultivate or grow plants and produce food."

  {
   "question": "What is ley farming?",
   "answer": "Farming is very difficult in dry lands because of water scarcity and lack of soil fertility, so a method of farming was introduced to restore the fertility of the soil and was known as ley farming. In this method of farming, grasses were grown in rotation with food grains to boost the nutrient level of the soil. It acts as an insurance against crop failures due to drought conditions."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is contour farming?",
   "answer": "The process of planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. In this practice the ruts made by the plough are perpendicular to the slope rather than being parallel. Plants break the flow of water and prevent soil erosion, thereby making contour farming a sustainable way of farming."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is hedgerow intercropping?",
   "answer": "The practice of growing annual crops in between the rows of trees as an alternate method of fallow system is termed as hedgerow intercropping. The combination of trees and crops complement each other rather than competing. The trees create a favourable micro-climate for the crops to survive by shielding them from drying winds."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is a crop rotation?",
   "answer": "The method of growing different types of crops in the same area during sequenced seasons is called crop rotation. This is done mainly to prevent soil erosion due to mono-cropping. It is very clearly known that growing only a certain variety of crops in the same area depletes the region of one particular kind of nutrient, therefore, to keep or maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil a different crop is grown for a certain duration or season to help restore the imbalance."

  {
   "question": "What is harrowing in agriculture and how is it done?",
   "answer": "Harrowing is breaking up the soil and smoothing its surface for planting crops. Generally, after the ploughing operation, the soil has a very rough and unfinished texture which is not suitable for farming. The clods or lumps of soil are broken up into a fine powder like substance and made extremely soft for planting saplings or sowing seeds. Harrowing is also done to remove weeds, but the intensity is low and is called coarser harrowing. There are machines available for harrowing like disc harrows, tine harrows, spring tooth harrows, drag harrows, chain harrows etc. traditional harrowing was done by draft animals, but now the equipment is being mounted on a tractor and manual labourers perform the operation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How is soil useful in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Soil is the first basic requirement while farming because it is the main source of nutrients to the plants. Healthy soil produces the most food. The soil is considered as a living, dynamic ecosystem that helps in converting dead, decayed matter into nutrients with the presence of microorganisms."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the purpose of land preparation?",
   "answer": "The main idea of land preparation is to get the soil or field ready for planting and this may involve activities like removal of weeds and unwanted materials like stones, recycling plant nutrients, making the soil fine in texture etc. Land preparation has to be carried out either by zero-tillage or minimum tillage so as to keep the soil disturbance levels minimum because a totally puddled soil would have a destroyed structure for cultivation. Tilling the soil can be done by ploughing, harrowing and levelling"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is planting in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Incorporating the saplings or seeds in the main farming area after proper land preparation is called planting. It is basically of two types: direct seeding and transplanting."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why tillage is important?",
   "answer": "Tilling is deep ploughing the land almost to the depth of 8-10 inches while preparing the soil for cultivation. When the soil condition is very poor, then a large quantity of organic matter has to be incorporated into it and this can be done only by tilling the soil. Other important reasons for tilling the soil could be facilitating air circulation, decomposition, etc. Tilling can be done in many ways and is expected to have its own advantages and disadvantages."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is land cleaning or clearing?",
   "answer": "The process of removing trees, stumps, brush, stones and other unwanted substances from the farm area is called land clearing. Doing so improves the productivity of the land and provides a new land base for next crop cycle. The land clearing process also involves piling up the debris and disposing it by burning the pile. Land is cleared using clearing equipment maintained by trained operators. Piling rakes and blades are also used while cleaning."

  },
  {
   "question": "What is the difference between transplanting and sowing?",
   "answer": "The term ‘sowing’ is used when seeds are sown directly into the prepared area or nursery pots or bags. Sowing seeds need a different soil condition and environment for proper germination. The depth of sowing and the management practices while handling seeds is considered risky. Plants grown directly from seeds have a long cultivation time period."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the methods of planting crops in the farm?",
   "answer": "There are two major ways in which planting could be done are direct seeding and transplanting. Direct seeding refers to planting the seeds in the fields for growing crops, whereas transplanting refers to planting saplings or seedlings that have been grown in nurseries from seeds."
  },
  {
   "question": "What crops can be directly seeded and what should be transplanted?",
   "answer": "Generally, cereal crops such as rice, corn, millets, sorghum; pulses (soybean, peanut); large seeded vegetables (squash, melons); root vegetables, leafy vegetables are grown by direct seeding."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are broadcasting and transplanting?",
   "answer": "Scattering the seeds on the farm area either manually or mechanically is called broadcast seeding. This is exactly opposite or in contrast to precision seeding (planting seeds at the proper depth and place) and hydro seeding (spraying slurry of seeds, mulch and water in a uniform layer over prepared farm areas). The broadcasting method needs 10-20% extra seeds for sowing when compared to other sowing methods."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why are grains dried before storage?",
   "answer": "If grains that have been freshly harvested are stored without drying, then they may be spoiled due to micro-organism infestation. Drying the grains removes moisture from them so as to improve their shelf life and reduce the attack by insects, pests, bacteria and fungi. If the grains or seeds are to be used for sowing then moist grains lose the ability of germination very fast. So it is always advised to dry the seeds up to 12% before storing."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why are seeds treated before sowing?",
   "answer": "Seeds are treated with chemicals prior to planting so as to protect them from microbial attacks and decay. The main aim of coating the seeds with insecticides and fungicides is to keep them safe from diseases. Chemicals are also coated over the seeds to increase the germinating ability of the seeds."

  {
   "question": "What is a cover crop in farming and what are its benefits?",
   "answer": "Cover crops are also called green manure crops and are primarily used to repair the soil structure. Cover crops aid in sustainable farming and aim to improve the agro-ecosystem. Examples of cover crops are legumes (peas and beans), mustard, daikon, wheat, barley and rye. Some exceptional benefits of cover crops are:"
  },
  {
   "question": "Why do farmers use a combination of manures and fertilizers in their fields?",
   "answer": "Manure is an organic matter which has many nutrients packed into a tremendously interconnected structure (like a web). Generally, if only a required nutrient is applied as fertilizer to the plants, then there is a possible risk of it being leached away or lost due to fixation. This results in insufficient supply of nutrient to the plant, but if fertilizer is applied long with manure then it remains in the soil structure (packed in the net like structure of manure) without getting leached and is made available for the plants."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is dibbling method?",
   "answer": "Dibbling is a method of cultivation, which uses an instrument called dibbler to plant seeds into the soil. A dibbler is a pointed stick that creates hole in the ground and plants the seed or seedling into it. Dibbling is not just placing the seedlings into the hole; it is used in conjunction with another process called puddling. Puddling is planting a seedling into a small hole filled with water in the ground."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is irrigation in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Irrigation in agriculture refers to the controlled application of water through man-made systems. These systems are particularly designed to solve the problem of crop watering in non-rainfed or low rainfed areas. Water is required by the plants to facilitate the upward movement of nutrients. Water around the plants also lowers the temperature in the area. Some irrigation systems for agricultural practices are drip, furrow, flood, gravity, sprinkler, sub-irrigation and center-pivot irrigation."

   "question": "What is parthenium?",
   "answer": "Parthenium hysterophorus L., commonly known as carrot weed, white top or --- congress grass in India,\nis an herbaceous, erect and annual plant belonging to the family Asteracae (compositae). It is most popularly known as gajar ghas due to its appearance like carrot plant. The origin of parthenium is considered to be from Mexico, America, Trinidad and Argentina. After noticeable occurrence of parthenium in Pune (Maharashtra) in 1955, it has spread like a wild fire throughout India. At present parthenium has invaded about 35 million hectares of land on In\ndian. It is a nuisance on road sides and railway tracks, vacant lands, wastelands, industrial areas, on the sides of open drainage system and irrigation canals besides invading agricultural crops, orchards and forest area. It mainly spreads through seeds. A single plant can produce about 5000 – 25000 seeds. The seeds are very small in size and light in weight."

Besides ill effects, it also causes several other problems like blockage of common pathways and reduces the aesthetic"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is biological control?",
   "answer": "Biological control is the intentional manipulation of natural enemies by man for the purpose of controlling harmful weeds. Biological control seldom means complete eradication of the unwanted organism, but rather maintaining its population at lower than average that would occur in the absence of the bio-control agent. Parthenium is mainly a weed of waste and fallow land, hence, biological control is the most economical and practical way to keep the weed under check."
  },
  {
   "question": "How biological control works?",
   "answer": "Under the biological control programme, host specific bio agents from the native home of the weed are imported into other countries, where the weed had entered and became invasive. Biological control is inexpensive and poses no threat to non-target organisms, environment and biodiversity. It is self-perpetuating and can spreads by its own while other control measures require inputs periodically. It is easy to integrate with other control measures."

   "question": "Biology of Mexican beetle"
  },
  {
   "question": "How beetles kill the parthenium?",
   "answer": "Both adults and larvae are capable to feed on parthenium leaves. Larvae after hatching start to feed on soft growing leaves, first attacking the terminal and axillary buds and later the leaf blades, thus checking completely the plant growth and flower production. Adults voraciously defoliate the plant. Immature flowers are cut by the beetles in an effort to chew soft tissues beneath the flowers. Completely defoliated plants start to show die back symptoms and gradually get killed. Small and succulents plants are more vulnerable to larvae and beetles attack and are nipped in the bud. In many states of India, beetle has establishment and contributing to control several hundred hectares of land fully infested with parthenium. At many places, beetle even controlled parthenium in the crop fields where insets searched the parthenium amidst the crop and devoured it."

  {
   "question": "Efforts of DWSR",
   "answer": "Directorate of Weed Science Research (DWSR) has intensified biological warfare against parthenium involving Krishi Vigyan Kendra, NGOs, local residents and farmers. At many places in M.P. beetles were released in the programme arranged with the collaboration of NGOs, residential societies, clubs, municipalities etc., involving local leaders. DWSR has also supplied nucleus cultures of the beetle to different All India Coordinated Research Programme on Weed Control (AICRPWC) Centres in 14 states apart from supplying to KWKs, farmers, municipalities and interested persons in almost all the states."
  },
  {
   "question": "Collection for augmentation of the beetles",
   "answer": "The beetles can easily be collected from the established sites during June to September. Collection can be made in ordinary polythene or plastic containers that are perforated with a needle. Upper parthenium twigs without leaves should be placed inside the polythene to avoid the shrinking and to provide resting place for the insect. If the insects have to be carried over long distances, it is better to avoid leaves to prevent moisture condensation and fungal growth, which can cause insect mortality. Care must be taken to make the initial releases on small and succulent growth of parthenium in undisturbed areas away from human habitations. Initial release should be avoided in cultivated land because ploughing of land may disturb the pupation process hence poor survival and subsequent establishment. Low lying areas prone to water logging should also be avoided because pupation takes place in soil. The ideal time for carrying out releases will be June to August when plenty of fresh parthenium plants are available in nature. There is no benefit in undertaking releases between Novembers to May when they normally do not breed. However, during this period, beetle can be released over parthenium near the water sources"
  },
  {
   "question": "Can beetle harm other crops?",
   "answer": "There are no chances or harming other crops as beetle is host specific. It cannot survive on food other than Parthenium. A controversy emerged on the feeding status of Z. bicolorata sunflower ended in 1999, based on the report of “Fact Finding Committee\" constituted by Indian Council of Agricultural Research."
  },
  {
   "question": "How many beetles should be released?",
   "answer": "One adult was found to bring defoliation of a single parthenium plant in 6-8 weeks. Therefore, if releases are to be carried out at this rate, about 0.4. to 0.7 million insects will be required per hectare, as the weed density varies between 40 to 70 plants per square metre. In practice, it is neither possible nor necessary to release so many insects as they are capable of multiplying rapidly. Releases of about 500-1000 beetles can bring about establishment and eventual control. Once plants are eaten up in the release spot the insects migrate into adjacent areas. Taking this into consideration, a number of release spots can be selected in a particular place or city, which can act as a focal point."

  {
   "question": "What is plant nutrition",
   "answer": "Plants use inorganic minerals for nutrition. Complex interactions involving weathering of rock minerals, decaying organic matter, animals, and microbes take place to form inorganic minerals in soil. Roots absorb mineral nutrients as ions in soil water. Many factors influence nutrient uptake for plants. Ions can be readily available to roots or could be \"tied up\" by other elements or the soil itself. Soil too high in pH (alkaline) or too low (acid) makes minerals unavailable to plants."
  },
  {
   "question": "Fertility or nutrition",
   "answer": "The term \"fertility\" refers to the inherent capacity of a soil to supply nutrients to plants in adequate amounts and in suitable proportions. The term \"nutrition\" refers to the interrelated steps by which a living organism assimilates food and uses it for growth and replacement of tissue. Previously, plant growth was thought of in terms of soil fertility or how much fertilizer should be added to increase soil levels of mineral elements. Most fertilizers were formulated to account for deficiencies of mineral elements in the soil. The use of soilless mixes and increased research in nutrient cultures and hydroponics as well as advances in plant tissue analysis have led to a broader understanding of plant nutrition."

   "question": "Early drought",
   "answer": "In case of early drought in the month of June and July due to delayed monsoon, the farmers either are unable to sow the crop or the sown crop is damaged. Early medium duration varieties (105-120 days) like Naveen, Satabdi, Lalat, Annada, Chandan, Sahbhagi Dhan, etc. can be transplanted using 15 days old seedlings up to September first week with basal application of 40:40:40 kg N, P2O5 and K2O for better establishment in rainfed shallow lowlands. If receipt of rainfall is delayed upto August end, early maturing rice varieties (90-105 days) like Vandana, Kalinga III, Anjali, Sahbhagi dhan, Khandagiri, Parijat, Narendra 97 can be grown in rainfed shallow lowlands by direct seeding upto end of August with basal application of 30 kg P2O5 and 30 kg K2O for better establishment. Initial Nitrogen fertilizer dose @ 30 kg ha-1 should be applied 7-15 days after sowing. In medium lowlands, where direct seeding is not feasible, farmers are advised to take up either transplanting of the available aged seedlings (upto 60 days old) of long duration varieties viz., Gayatri, Sarala, Varshadhan, etc. or transplanting of clonal seedlings from the surviving rice crop in the neighboring fields at closer spacing (15 x 10 cm) with basal application of 40:40:40 kg N, P2O5 and K2O. In coastal saline areas, transplanting of aged seedlings of salt tolerant rice varieties like Lunishree, Luna Suvarna, Luna Sampad, SR 26B, etc. can be done upto September first week with basal application of 30:30:30 kg N, P2O5 and K2O. In above situations, it is advisable to raise the bund height and plug the holes in the bunds to arrest the seepage loss and keep the fields weed free. In the case of delayed transplanting or direct seeding during August or early September, foliar spray of insecticides like thiamethoxam 1g/l or imidacloprid 0.5ml/l or ethofenprox 1ml/l or chlorpyrifos 2ml/l should be applied at 15-20 days after transplanting for late- planted rice pests like thrips, swarming caterpiller, hispa, gall midge and case worm. For leaf folder, all the above insecticides can be applied only except chlorpyrifos. At the non-availability of insecticides, neem oil can be applied @ 5ml/l with 2ml detergent liquid. A foliar spray should be applied at first brood emergence of YSB/ at the ceasation of rain/during 1st week of October for YSB and leaf folder control. In the case of failing to notice the brood emergence of YSB, carbofuran granules can be applied @ 30 kg ha-1 at panicle initiation stage of the crop. In the case of gundhi bug infestation at the milk stage of early duration varieties, a foliar spray of any insecticide can be applied, preferably during early morning. In uplands, if rice crop is not yet sown or damaged due to drought, farmers should take up short duration low water requiring crops like cowpea (Utkalmanika), blackgram (T-9, Sarala, PU 19, 30), green gram (K851), Horsegram (Urmi) and Sesamum ( Kanak, Kalika, Uma, Usha)."

   "question": "General recommendations in moisture management in horticulture",
   "answer": "Selection of suitable crops and varieties\nIn vegetable crops like dolichos bean, cowpea, cluster bean, lima bean, chilli, drumstick, brinjal, okra are suitable for rain-fed cultivation. Among these, legume vegetables can be recommended for contingency crop-planning in an eventuality of late monsoon rains. Varieties having good root system and capacity to recoup after the alleviation of stress need to be selected. Depending upon situation, it is recommended to use short duration varieties.\nImproved method of seedling production\nImproved method of seedling production such as Protray grown seedling using coco peat, nylon net protection and bio-fertilizers/bio-pesticide inoculation at nursery stage has good potential for obtaining sturdy, uniform and healthy seedlings. These seedlings when transplanted in the main-field will establish better with less root damage and fare better in overcoming biotic and abiotic stresses particularly during water stress conditions.\nAdoption of soil and moisture conservation techniques\nContour cultivation, contour trip cropping, mixed Cropping, tillage, mulching, zero tillage, are some of the agronomical measures for the in-situ soil moisture conservation. Mechanical measures like contour bunding, graded bunding, bench terracing, vertical mulching etc. also need to be followed for effective soil and moisture conservation in dry lands. Another technology for efficient utilization of runoff is water harvesting recycling. Rainwater harvesting includes collecting runoff water into dug out ponds or tanks in small depressions, gullies and into storage dams of earth or masonry structures. Rain water harvesting is possible in areas having rainfall as little as 500 to 800 mm. Depending on the rainfall and soil characteristics, 10-50 % of the runoff can be collected in farm pond. Surface run off thus collected in a farm pond can be used to provide protective irrigation in the period of prolonged dry spell or through microirrigation techniques.\nEnhancing soil organic matter content\nConstant efforts must be made to improve the soil organic carbon. Incorporation of crop residues and farm yard manure to soil improves the organic matter status, improves soil structure and soil moisture storage capacity. Organic matter content of the soil can also be improved by fallowing alley cropping, green manuring, crop rotation and agro forestry. Vegetable being short duration crop and having faster growth phases, the available organic matter needs to be properly composted. Vermicomposting can be followed for quicker usage of available organic matter in the soil and improving the soil moisture holding capacity.\nApplication of foliar nutrition:\nThe foliar application of nutrients during water stress conditions helps in the better growth by quick absorption of nutrients. The spraying of K and Ca induces drought tolerance in vegetable crops. Spraying of micronutrients and secondary nutrients improves crop yields and quality.\nUse of drip irrigation\nDrip irrigation has proved its superiority over other conventional method of irrigation, in Horticulture due to precise and direct application of water in root zone. A considerable saving in water, increased growth, development and yields of fruits and vegetables and control of weeds, saving in labour under drip irrigation are the added advantages. Drip irrigation can be adopted in fruit crops and also to all vegetable crops including closed spaced crops like onions and beans.The saving in water is to the tune of 30-50 % depending on the crop and season. Generally inline drip laterals having emitting point spaced at 30cm distance and emitting at the rate of 2LPH is selected for vegetable crops. In crops like chilli, brinjal, cauliflower and okra paired row planting is practiced and one drip lateral is used for two crop rows.\nUse of micro sprinkler irrigation\nDepending upon situation and availability of water, this technology can be used for fruits and vegetable crops. The cost of initial establishment is lower compared to drip system. Further in summer the sprinkling of water helps in reducing the microclimate temperature and increasing the humidity, thereby improving the growth and yield of the crop. The water saved is to the tune of 20 to 30 per cent.\nMoisture saving methods under limited water resource conditions:\nThe following methods may be adopted under limited water conditions to save water:\nWater saving irrigation method\nUnder limited water situations, water-saving irrigation methods like alternate furrow irrigation or widely spaced furrow irrigation and drip irrigation systems can be adopted. Studies conducted on methods of irrigation in capsicum, tomato, okra and cauliflower indicated that adopting alternate-furrow irrigation and widely-spaced furrow irrigation saved 35 to 40 per cent of irrigation water without adversely affecting yield.\nMulching Practices in Vegetable Production\nThe technique of covering the soil with natural crop residues or plastic films for soil and water conservation is called mulching. Mulching can be practiced in fruits and vegetable crops using crop residues and other organic material available in the farm. Recently plastic mulches have come into use due to the inherent advantages of efficient moisture conservation, weed suppression and maintenance of soil structure. Wide variety of vegetables can be successfully grown using mulches. In addition to soil and water conservation, improved yield and quality, suppression of weed growth , mulches can improve the use efficiency of applied fertilizer nutrients and also use of reflective mulches are likely to minimize the incidence of virus diseases. For vegetable production generally polyethylene mulch film of 30micron thick and 1 to 1.2 m width is used. Generally raised bed with drip irrigation system is followed while laying the mulch film.\nWind breaks, hedges and intercropping:\nTo overcome the adverse effect of high temperature and dry winds, tall growing trees need to be planted all along the boundary of the farm. Inter cropping of vegetable crops of the area can be practiced in orchards during summer months. Maize/ Sorghum can be grown all along the border of the plot to mitigate the effect of desiccating winds.\nUse of protected cultivation of vegetables\nIn peri-urban regions where climate does not favour year round production of crops in the open field, vegetable production can be taken up in protected environment. Protective structure is a facility to protect crop from biotic and abiotic constraints. Structures for protected cultivation include green houses, plastic/net houses and “tunnels”. Commonly used protected structures are polyhouses and net or shade houses. Rain-shelter is a simple structure covered with polyethylene sheet which helps in producing the crops which are affected by excessive rainfall. The productivity of tomato, onions and melons are adversely affected in the event of high rainfall due to difficulty in managing the foliar diseases, lack of proper soil aeration and drainage and also depending on the nature of crop physical damage of the foliage and flower drop. Net house cultivation and shade net cultivation provide better microclimate especially during summer in minimizing the high temperature effect and improving the relative humidity. The productivity of tomato, French bean and capsicum can be improved during high temperature period by using net/shade net on the top.\nControl of leaf miner and mite during high temperature stress\nFor management of leaf miner spray neem soap 4 grams / liter or triazophos at the rate 1.5 ml / l. To manage mites spray Abanectin 0.5 ml/l. Aphids may be observed in case of beans. Spray neem soap (1.0 %) or neem seed kernel extract (4.00 %)."

   "question": "Mango",
   "answer": "During establishment stage of mango in the field, sub-soil irrigation through pitcher buried 10 cm from the plant, 1 foot below ground level, covered by a plastic plate and fed through a 3 cm diameter pipe with 1.25 liters of water applied/plant/day and mulched with sugarcane thrash mulch (1.0 kg/basin) results in better establishment. Black polyethylene film (100 micro thick) helps in conservation of moisture and increase in root growth, flowering, fruiting and minimum fruit drop with enhancement in yield. Rain water harvesting through opening of circular trenches around trees at a distance of 6 feet and width at 9 inches, as well as depth and mulching the trenches with dry mango leaves, helps in retaining sufficient moisture in the soil during flowering and fruiting and increase in yield. Drip irrigation along with crop residue mulch helps in water saving. Drip irrigation with 0.6 volumes of water and plastic mulch significantly increases the yield. The water stress immediately after fruit set increases fruit drop in mango. Hence, protective irrigation is essential during the fruit development period. Due to high temperature stress in many areas leaf fall is observed. To overcome the leaf fall and to enhance the turgidity spray 0.2 % cent Potassium Sulphate."

   "question": "Banana",
   "answer": "The soil moisture deficit stress in banana during vegetative stage causes poor bunch formation, lower number and small sized fingers. The water stress during flowering causes poor filling of fingers and unmarketable bunches and reduced bunch weight and other growth parameters. Providing irrigation through drip helps in reducing the adverse effects of water stress. Plant Protection Measures - High temperatures along with low humidity are congenial for flare up of sucking pests like thrips and mites in fruit crops viz., mango, grapes, and pomegranate. Proper monitoring and timely spraying of recommend pesticides will bring down the severity of incidence. For thrips, insecticides like thiamethoxam 25WG@ 0.25 g/L or Acephate 75SP @1.5 g/l or spinosad 45 % SC @ 0.5 ml/l will bring down the thrips infestation.

   "question": "Litchi",
   "answer": "Litchi being an evergreen plant, the maintenance of optimum soil moisture is critical for growth, development and fruit production. It is adapted to warm subtropics, cropping best in region with brief dry frost free winters and long, hot summers with high rainfall and humidity. If rainfall is evenly distributed, litchi is grown successfully and supplementary water requirement depends upon cultivar and evaporation demand. To achieve faster growth of the plant, no water stress should be permitted, while in the reproductive phase water stress is beneficial at the time of panicle emergence, flowering and fruit bud differentiation (February-March). Light irrigation but at frequent short intervals during summer months and cleaning of the basin is advocated (April-May). Certain physiological disorders like poor sex ratio, poor fruit set, heavy fruit drop and high fruit cracking and sunburn of the fruit are more intense under water deficit in the rhizosphere and can be minimized with proper water management (March–May). Early flushing, proper vegetative growth and shoot development are very much influenced by the timely onset of monsoon, without any additional irrigation (June-September). Intercultural operations, pruning and training operation and summer ploughing is followed just after harvesting of the fruits, dependent on cultivars (June -July). Arrival of monsoon brings, great change in weather conditions, immediately the atmosphere becomes saturated with moisture and relative humidity goes high (>90 %). It also marks disappearance of dry heat, scorching loo, winds and appearance of wet and cold air, thunderstorms, cumulus clouds having overhead, which give a good boost to vegetative growth of litchi. The phase change i.e. vegetative to reproductive stage require induction of cool/low temperature with mild stress condition with restricted or no supplemental irrigation. Fruit development, fruit yield and quality require regular monitoring of nutrients and moisture with good management practices during pre - monsoon period for economically viable harvest."

   "question": "Cultural practices",
   "answer": "Preparation of nurseries or main fields free from pest infestation by removing plant debris, trimming of bunds, treating of soil and deep summer ploughing which kills various stages of pests. Proper drainage system in field is to be adopted. Testing of soil for nutrients deficiencies on the basis of which fertilizers should be applied. Selection of clean and certified seeds and treating seeds with fungicide or biopesticides before sowing for seed borne disease control. Selection of seeds of relatively pest resistant/tolerant varieties which play a significant role in pest suppression. Adjustment of time of sowing and harvesting to escape peak season of pest attack. Rotation of crops with non-host crops. It helps in reduction of incidence of soil borne diseases. Proper plant spacing which makes plants healthier and less susceptible to pests. Optimum use of fertilizer. Use of FYM and biofertilizers should be encouraged. Proper water management (alternate wetting and drying to avoid water stagnation) as the high moisture in soil for prolonged period is conducive for development of pests especially soil borne diseases. Proper weed management. It is well known fact that most of weeds besides competing with crop for micronutrients also harbour many pests. Setting up yellow pan sticky traps for white flies and aphids at far above canopy height. Synchronized sowing. Here, community approach is required to sow the crops simultaneously in vast area so that pest may not get different staged crops suitable for its population build up. If pest appears in damaging proportion, control operation could also be applied effectively in whole area. Growing trap crops on the borders or peripheries of fields. There are certain crops which are preferred more by a pest species. These are known as trap crops for that pest. By growing such crops on the border of the fields, pest population develop there which can be either killed by using pesticides or its natural enemies are allowed to develop there for natural control. Root dip or seedling treatment in pest infested area. Inter-cropping or multiple cropping wherever possible. All the crops are not preferred by each pest species and certain crops act as repellents, thus keeping the pest species away from preferred crops resulting in reduction of pest incidence. Harvesting as close as to ground level. This is because certain developmental stages of insect pests/diseases remain on the plant parts which act as primary inoculum for the next crop season. Hence, harvesting crops at ground level will lessen the incidence of pests in next season. Before planting, nursery plants could be sprayed/dipped in copper fungicide/biopesticide solutions to protect the plants from soil borne diseases. While pruning fruit trees remove crowded/dead/broken/diseased branches and destroy them. Do not pile them in the orchards which may act as source of pest infestation. Large pruning wounds should be covered with Bordeaux paste/paint to protect the plants from pest/disease attack. For excellent fruit set, pollinizer cultivars should be planted in required proportion in the orchards. Keeping bee hives or placing flower bouquets of pollinizer cultivars facilitate better pollination and subsequent fruit set."

   "question": "Mechanical practices",
   "answer": "Removal and destruction of egg masses, larvae, pupae and adults of insect pests and diseased parts of plants wherever possible. Installation of bamboo cage cum bird perches in the field and placing parasitized egg masses inside them for conservation of natural enemies and withholding of pest species wherever possible. Use of light traps and destruction of trapped insects. Use of rope for dislodging leaf feeding larvae e.g. caseworm and leaf folders. Installation of bird scarer in the field where required. Installation of bird perches in the field for allowing birds to sit and feed on insects and their immature stages viz., eggs, larvae and pupae. Use of pheromones for mating disruption, monitoring pest levels and mass trapping."

   "question": "Regulatory practices",
   "answer": "In this process, regulatory rules framed by Govt. are brought into force under which seeds and infested plant materials are not allowed to enter the country or from one part to other parts of the country. These are known as quarantine methods and are of two types i.e. domestic and foreign quarantine."

   "question": "Biological practices",
   "answer": "Biological control of insect pests and diseases through biological means is most important component of IPM. In broader sense, biocontrol is use of living organisms to manage crop damaging living organisms (pests)."

  {
   "question": "Chemical practices",
   "answer": "Use of chemical pesticides is the last resort when all other methods fail to keep the pest population below economic loss. Use of pesticides should be need based, judicious, based on pest surveillance and economic threshold level (ETL). This helps minimise not only the cost involved, but also to reduce associated problems. While going for chemical control, we must understand thoroughly what to spray, when to spray, where to spray and how to spray, keeping in mind the following points."

  {
   "question": "What is the importance of agriculture?",
   "answer": "Sometimes it is observed that agriculture is not just production of materials, but it also involves promotion, processing and distribution of produced materials. Agriculture is important because of the following reasons:\nSource of Livelihood\nContribution to National Income\nSupply of Food and Fodder\nVast Employment Opportunities\nOverall Economic Development\nSource of Government Income\n"
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the branches of agriculture?",
   "answer": "The different branches of agriculture are horticulture, aquaculture, dairy farming, organic farming, poultry, sericulture, vermiculture and market gardening. If the broad definition of agriculture is taken into consideration then it could also involve branches, like seed technology, Nematology, plant breeding and genetics, soil science, agronomy etc."

  {
   "question": "How do farmers grow their crops?",
   "answer": "Farmers need to understand the local growing conditions, soil requirements, crop compatibility, etc. to have a successful farming business. The basic knowledge of cultivation along with the required resources helps farmers to grow their crops. The general requirements are soil/land, nutrients/fertilizers, air, water, sunlight and of course farm equipment. Apart from all these, farmers need investment (money) for getting seeds, manure, irrigation facilities, labour and other farm materials to begin with. Using all these resources at the right time for the right crop, farmers cultivate or grow plants and produce food."

   "question": "What are the methods of farming?",
   "answer": "Some methods for sustainable farming are:"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is ley farming?",
   "answer": "Farming is very difficult in dry lands because of water scarcity and lack of soil fertility, so a method of farming was introduced to restore the fertility of the soil and was known as ley farming. In this method of farming, grasses were grown in rotation with food grains to boost the nutrient level of the soil. It acts as an insurance against crop failures due to drought conditions."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is contour farming?",
   "answer": "The process of planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. In this practice the ruts made by the plough are perpendicular to the slope rather than being parallel. Plants break the flow of water and prevent soil erosion, thereby making contour farming a sustainable way of farming."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is hedgerow intercropping?",
   "answer": "The practice of growing annual crops in between the rows of trees as an alternate method of fallow system is termed as hedgerow intercropping. The combination of trees and crops complement each other rather than competing. The trees create a favourable micro-climate for the crops to survive by shielding them from drying winds."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is a crop rotation?",
   "answer": "The method of growing different types of crops in the same area during sequenced seasons is called crop rotation. This is done mainly to prevent soil erosion due to mono-cropping. It is very clearly known that growing only a certain variety of crops in the same area depletes the region of one particular kind of nutrient, therefore, to keep or maintain the balance of nutrients in the soil a different crop is grown for a certain duration or season to help restore the imbalance."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the advantages of crop rotation?",
   "answer": "The general pattern of following a seasonal calendar for planting crops is now being termed as crop rotation and the possible advantages of this technique as:"

  {
   "question": "What are the duties of a farmer?",
   "answer": "A farmer has to carry out different tasks throughout the crop lifecycle and has to undertake a different set of duties if he is livestock farming . Most important activities of a farmer are cleaning, tractor driving, ploughing, planting, managing livestock, feeding livestock, harvesting, marketing of produce, carrying out intercultural activities, fertilizing, irrigating, farm maintenance etc."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the steps in agriculture?",

   "answer": "Crop production has too many benefits on different aspects of farming because of proper maintenance during the entire cycle such as:"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is harrowing in agriculture and how is it done?",
   "answer": "Harrowing is breaking up the soil and smoothing its surface for planting crops. Generally, after the ploughing operation, the soil has a very rough and unfinished texture which is not suitable for farming. The clods or lumps of soil are broken up into a fine powder like substance and made extremely soft for planting saplings or sowing seeds. Harrowing is also done to remove weeds, but the intensity is low and is called coarser harrowing. There are machines available for harrowing like disc harrows, tine harrows, spring tooth harrows, drag harrows, chain harrows etc. traditional harrowing was done by draft animals, but now the equipment is being mounted on a tractor and manual labourers perform the operation."
  },
  {
   "question": "How is soil useful in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Soil is the first basic requirement while farming because it is the main source of nutrients to the plants. Healthy soil produces the most food. The soil is considered as a living, dynamic ecosystem that helps in converting dead, decayed matter into nutrients with the presence of microorganisms."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the purpose of land preparation?",
   "answer": "The main idea of land preparation is to get the soil or field ready for planting and this may involve activities like removal of weeds and unwanted materials like stones, recycling plant nutrients, making the soil fine in texture etc. Land preparation has to be carried out either by zero-tillage or minimum tillage so as to keep the soil disturbance levels minimum because a totally puddled soil would have a destroyed structure for cultivation. Tilling the soil can be done by ploughing, harrowing and levelling"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is planting in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Incorporating the saplings or seeds in the main farming area after proper land preparation is called planting. It is basically of two types: direct seeding and transplanting."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why tillage is important?",
   "answer": "Tilling is deep ploughing the land almost to the depth of 8-10 inches while preparing the soil for cultivation. When the soil condition is very poor, then a large quantity of organic matter has to be incorporated into it and this can be done only by tilling the soil. Other important reasons for tilling the soil could be facilitating air circulation, decomposition, etc. Tilling can be done in many ways and is expected to have its own advantages and disadvantages."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is land cleaning or clearing?",
   "answer": "The process of removing trees, stumps, brush, stones and other unwanted substances from the farm area is called land clearing. Doing so improves the productivity of the land and provides a new land base for next crop cycle. The land clearing process also involves piling up the debris and disposing it by burning the pile. Land is cleared using clearing equipment maintained by trained operators. Piling rakes and blades are also used while cleaning."
  },
  {
   "question": "What",
   "answer": "The crop production cycle depends on two major factors, i.e. internal and external factors. The internal factors that influence the crop growth relate to the genetic capability of the seed or variety of crop being cultivated and the desirable characteristics for proper production are:"
  },
  {
   "question": "What is the difference between transplanting and sowing?",
   "answer": "The term ‘sowing’ is used when seeds are sown directly into the prepared area or nursery pots or bags. Sowing seeds need a different soil condition and environment for proper germination. The depth of sowing and the management practices while handling seeds is considered risky. Plants grown directly from seeds have a long cultivation time period."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are the methods of planting crops in the farm?",
   "answer": "There are two major ways in which planting could be done are direct seeding and transplanting. Direct seeding refers to planting the seeds in the fields for growing crops, whereas transplanting refers to planting saplings or seedlings that have been grown in nurseries from seeds."
  },
  {
   "question": "What crops can be directly seeded and what should be transplanted?",
   "answer": "Generally, cereal crops such as rice, corn, millets, sorghum; pulses (soybean, peanut); large seeded vegetables (squash, melons); root vegetables, leafy vegetables are grown by direct seeding."
  },
  {
   "question": "What are broadcasting and transplanting?",
   "answer": "Scattering the seeds on the farm area either manually or mechanically is called broadcast seeding. This is exactly opposite or in contrast to precision seeding (planting seeds at the proper depth and place) and hydro seeding (spraying slurry of seeds, mulch and water in a uniform layer over prepared farm areas). The broadcasting method needs 10-20% extra seeds for sowing when compared to other sowing methods."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why are grains dried before storage?",
   "answer": "If grains that have been freshly harvested are stored without drying, then they may be spoiled due to micro-organism infestation. Drying the grains removes moisture from them so as to improve their shelf life and reduce the attack by insects, pests, bacteria and fungi. If the grains or seeds are to be used for sowing then moist grains lose the ability of germination very fast. So it is always advised to dry the seeds up to 12% before storing."
  },
  {
   "question": "Why are seeds treated before sowing?",
   "answer": "Seeds are treated with chemicals prior to planting so as to protect them from microbial attacks and decay. The main aim of coating the seeds with insecticides and fungicides is to keep them safe from diseases. Chemicals are also coated over the seeds to increase the germinating ability of the seeds."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is a cover crop in farming and what are its benefits?",
   "answer": "Cover crops are also called green manure crops and are primarily used to repair the soil structure. Cover crops aid in sustainable farming and aim to improve the agro-ecosystem. Examples of cover crops are legumes (peas and beans), mustard, daikon, wheat, barley and rye. Some exceptional benefits of cover crops are:"
  },
  {
   "question": "Why do farmers use a combination of manures and fertilizers in their fields?",
   "answer": "Manure is an organic matter which has many nutrients packed into a tremendously interconnected structure (like a web). Generally, if only a required nutrient is applied as fertilizer to the plants, then there is a possible risk of it being leached away or lost due to fixation. This results in insufficient supply of nutrient to the plant, but if fertilizer is applied long with manure then it remains in the soil structure (packed in the net like structure of manure) without getting leached and is made available for the plants."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is dibbling method?",
   "answer": "Dibbling is a method of cultivation, which uses an instrument called dibbler to plant seeds into the soil. A dibbler is a pointed stick that creates hole in the ground and plants the seed or seedling into it. Dibbling is not just placing the seedlings into the hole; it is used in conjunction with another process called puddling. Puddling is planting a seedling into a small hole filled with water in the ground."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is irrigation in agriculture?",
   "answer": "Irrigation in agriculture refers to the controlled application of water through man-made systems. These systems are particularly designed to solve the problem of crop watering in non-rainfed or low rainfed areas. Water is required by the plants to facilitate the upward movement of nutrients. Water around the plants also lowers the temperature in the area. Some irrigation systems for agricultural practices are drip, furrow, flood, gravity, sprinkler, sub-irrigation and center-pivot irrigation."

   "answer": "Management practices help farmers conserve water and enhance production. Some typical practices include:"
  },
  {
   "question": "Which soil is most suitable for agriculture?",
   "answer": "All over the country, different types of soil could be found and each type has unique physical, chemical and biological characteristics. Alluvial soil is considered as the most fertile soil containing potassium in it and is suitable for agricultural crops like sugarcane, paddy and plantain. Red soil has high iron content and is used for gram, groundnut and castor seed cultivation. Black soil has high calcium, magnesium and potassium used of chilly, jowar, cotton, oilseed and maize cultivation. Finally, sandy soil has low nutrient content, but is useful in growing crops like coconut."
  },
  {
   "question": "What is Agro climatic zone",
   "answer": "An Agro-climatic zone is a land unit in terms of major climates, suitable for a certain range of crops and cultivars. The planning aims at scientific management of regional resources to meet the food, fiber, fodder and fuel wood without adversely affecting the status of natural resources and environment. Crop yield is (FAO, 1983). Agro-climatic conditions mainly refer to soil types, rainfall, temperature and water availability which influence the type of vegetations. An agro-ecological zone is the land unit carved out of agro-climatic zone superimposed on landform which acts as modifier to climate and length of growing period."
